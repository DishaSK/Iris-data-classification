# Iris data classification
Machine learning is a growing technology which enables computers to learn automatically from the past data. It also trains computers to take descisions based on their experience and trained dataset. Classification between different types of species or things in a given dataset turns out to be an application of machine learning. Hence in this notebook, classification of iris dataset is done using Python programming language and the following libraries namely numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplot are imported for the purpose of classification and viewing the results.
